## Relevant files and tidy data set:

CodeBook.md describes the variables, and the data. 

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the following steps. 

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final tidy data set "tidy.txt" is uploaded in the submission link.
